# ML for Robotic Fabrication – Triangle Hypotenuse Prediction

## Dataset
- 1000 samples of right-angle triangles
- Random values for sides a and b (1 to 100)
- Hypotenuse (c) calculated using Pythagoras’ theorem

## Model
- Linear Regression using `scikit-learn`
- Trained on 80% of the data, tested on 20%

## Evaluation
- Mean Squared Error: (your result here)
- R² Score: (your result here)

## Observations
- Simple regression models perform well due to the deterministic relationship between a, b, and c.
